    <p class="content"><span class="name">1. Rasgulla (Rosgulla, Rosogolla,
        Rasagolla):</span><br /><br />
      Rasgulla is a traditional sweet that is usually served at the end of a meal, like many other Indian
      milk-based desserts. It is prepared from chhena paneer dumplings and semolina dough, cooked together
      in a sugary syrup. The origin of rasgulla is the subject of a heated debate, with West Bengal and
      Odisha both claiming to be the birthplace of the dessert.

      Bengalis claim that rasgulla was the byproduct of many culinary experiments in the state, while the
      people of Odisha claim that it was traditionally offered to Lord Jagannath for centuries. However,
      most food historians agree that the truth is somewhere in between.
